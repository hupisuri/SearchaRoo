# SearchaRoo
An example for using Hibernate Search with Spring Boot. The data set is based on the MySQL employee database and enables fuzzy fulltext search on the first and last name of employee records. This example project covers the following aspects: 
* Model an existing database schema with POJOs
* Import a large data set
* Search the data in a fuzzy way
